/*     
- Comnponent will be main box for lists of photos I decide to upload / host. NOTE: I may still make a seperate component that is an expanded photo view. 
- TODO: I need to recieve what props?
    - Photo display / frame size.
    - photo url / location.
    - padding probably.
    - Potentially photo title / label / summary NOTE: I think Id like for it to be on mouse hover as well, for photo info.
